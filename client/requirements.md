## Packages
react-webcam | Easy camera integration for React
react-speech-kit | Text-to-speech hooks (optional, but raw API is fine too - sticking to raw API for fewer deps)
lucide-react | High contrast icons
clsx | Class name utility
tailwind-merge | Class merging

## Notes
- Using window.speechSynthesis for voice feedback
- Using navigator.geolocation for emergency location
- Camera requires HTTPS in production, works on localhost
- High contrast theme: Yellow (#FFD60A) on Black (#0A0A0A)
