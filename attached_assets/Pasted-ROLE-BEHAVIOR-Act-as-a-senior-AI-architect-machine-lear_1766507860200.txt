ROLE & BEHAVIOR

Act as a senior AI architect, machine learning engineer, and full-stack developer with real-world experience in assistive technology for visually impaired users.
You must think like a final-year project mentor and build a COMPLETE, CORRECT, PRODUCTION-READY system.
Do not skip any part.
Generate clean, structured, commented code and explain when needed.

🎓 PROJECT TITLE

Intelligent Blind Assistance and Emergency Support System using Machine Learning Techniques

🎯 PROJECT OBJECTIVE

Build an AI-powered assistive system for visually impaired users that:

Detects objects in real time

Reads printed text aloud (OCR)

Recognizes Indian currency notes

Converts all outputs to natural speech

Allows users to save personal information

Provides one-tap emergency assistance

Navigates users to saved addresses

Works with accessibility-first design

🧱 TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
Frontend

React.js

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Axios (API calls)

Camera API (live capture)

File upload

Geolocation API

Google Maps URL navigation

Accessibility-friendly UI (large buttons, high contrast)

Backend

Python

FastAPI

OpenCV (image preprocessing)

TensorFlow + MobileNet

Tesseract OCR

Google TTS API or ElevenLabs TTS

Database

MySQL

🧠 MACHINE LEARNING REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ Object Detection Model

Use MobileNet SSD

Dataset: COCO (or equivalent)

Classes: person, chair, door, vehicle, bottle

Output: object name + confidence

Return structured JSON

2️⃣ OCR Model

Use Tesseract OCR

Apply OpenCV preprocessing:

grayscale

thresholding

noise removal

Output extracted text

3️⃣ Currency Recognition Model

Build a CNN using MobileNet

Dataset: Indian currency notes (₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹200, ₹500)

Include:

dataset structure

training script

evaluation accuracy

saved .h5 model

Output predicted currency value

🔊 TEXT-TO-SPEECH REQUIREMENTS

Convert all results to speech

Support:

English (mandatory)

Tamil / Hindi (optional)

Return audio file or streamable URL

🚨 EMERGENCY & PERSONAL SAFETY MODULE (MANDATORY)
User Personal Information

Allow user to save:

Name

Home address

Emergency contact number

Alternate contact

Preferred language

Emergency Button Behavior

When user clicks Emergency Button:

Fetch saved emergency contact

Fetch saved address

Get live GPS location

Trigger:

Phone call (frontend)

Location sharing

Google Maps navigation

Speak voice confirmation

🗄️ DATABASE DESIGN (MANDATORY)
Tables:

users

scan_logs

emergency_logs

Include full SQL schema.

🔗 API DESIGN (MANDATORY)

Build these FastAPI endpoints:

POST /api/detect-object
POST /api/read-text
POST /api/detect-currency
POST /api/text-to-speech

POST /api/user/profile
GET  /api/user/profile

POST /api/emergency/trigger
GET  /api/scan-history

🖥️ FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS
Screens:

Home dashboard

Object detection screen

Text reading screen

Currency recognition screen

User profile screen

Emergency screen

UI Rules:

Large buttons

Minimal text

Voice feedback for every action

High contrast

One-tap emergency access

🧭 NAVIGATION FEATURE

When user clicks Navigate to Address

Open Google Maps using:

https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=<ADDRESS>


Speak:

“Navigation started to your saved address.”

🧪 LOGGING & HISTORY

Save every scan result

Save emergency actions

Allow viewing scan history
